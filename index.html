						You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it
						killed the
						world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now,
						I don't
						know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and
						only five
						made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that
						killed the
						other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.

								Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called a pilot. Then
								they show that show to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show
								they decide if they're going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked and become
								television programs. Some don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that
								became nothing.

								Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all makes sense! In

								opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends, like you and me! I should've known
								way back when... You know why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.
